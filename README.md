# Bootstrap Basics

## Objectives
- Style a webpage using bootstrap!
- Be able to explain what CSS frameworks are and why they’re useful.
- Understand that CSS frameworks provide pre-defined classes and selectors, and that you must write markup that matches the framework’s expectations.

## Setup

1. Create a local repository called 'bootstrap-basics' and add a remote on github with the same name.
1. Add a .html and readme.md, but no css.
1. Install the bootstrap framework using CDN
1. Commit and push to github (you know the drill)

## Steps

Add the following HTML elements to your page:
  1. Form asking for Input with a submit Button
  1. Table with table header
  1. Add paragraphs (use [this](http://hipsum.co/) for generated text) and images using the grid system
    1. Change responsiveness and visibility based on viewport. How would this look on your phone?
  1. Play around with it! Be Creative! Try new things!
